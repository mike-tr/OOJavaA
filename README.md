# OOJavaA

This is my michael ReadMe File.

Explanations:

First assignment, we use hashmap because we want to find nodes by the key.
We implement bfs in order to check if the graph connected,

and i use a path finding algorithem to find the shortest path,
its neither bfs nor anything else, i just know how to implement it,
was some kind of veriation of A*, but without most of what it needs.
