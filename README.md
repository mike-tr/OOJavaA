# OOJavaA

This is my michael ReadMe File.

Explanations:

First assignment, we use hashmap because we want to find nodes by the key.

We implement bfs in order to check if the graph connected,
we use ArrayDeque for that, as we need queues, and they are the fastest data structure for such operation,
not that ArrayList are very inefficient in this process and would slow down significantly.

and i use a path finding algorithem to find the shortest path,
its neither bfs nor anything else, i just know how to implement it,
was some kind of veriation of A*, but without most of what it needs.
